## Experience
   At the university, I studied computer science disciplines: networks, programming, database, administration, computational methods of information systems, CIS, information security, etc. In addition, there were lessons on process optimization and decision making, system engineering. During training, I solved problems in C, C++, SQL, built IDEF, UML diagrams. As part of my coursework, I solved some tasks on automation and electronic document management in C++ or C# using databases, and also developed a kind of CRM system. In my thesis work, I developed a design solution for automating a set of tasks for the logistics subsystem of the ACS of a large organization. At the moment I am studying at the school of Computer Science "Ecole 42" in Yerevan.
